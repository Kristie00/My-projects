# Welcome to my Project page! :wave:

Hi there! Thanks for visiting my GitHub Project page. 
On this page, you'll find a selection of projects that I completed during my time at Green Fox Academy Bootcamp. 
Below you'll find a list of my projects along with descriptions and links to their repositories.


### Project 1: [Trying out Data Engineering Tools]
In this section, we gained our first experience working with data engineering tools, specifically Kafka and Airflow. 
Using Kafka, we developed proficiency in creating producers and consumers, as well as in generating data files. In the case of Airflow, we gained familiarity with writing and executing DAGs.

### Project 2: [Databases]
Throughout this section, we acquired practical knowledge on utilizing SQL for manipulating relational databases in MSSQL. 
Furthermore, we also gained proficiency in managing document-oriented MongoDB databases through the usage of MongoDB Query Language.

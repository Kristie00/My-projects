# Welcome to my Project page! :wave:

Hi there! Thanks for visiting my GitHub Project page. 
On this page, you'll find a selection of projects that I completed during my time at Green Fox Academy Bootcamp. 
Below you'll find a list of my projects along with descriptions and links to their repositories.


### Part 1: Trying out Data Engineering Tools
In this section, we gained our first experience working with data engineering tools, specifically [Kafka](https://github.com/Kristie00/My-projects/tree/main/Kafka) and [Airflow](https://github.com/Kristie00/My-projects/tree/main/Airflow/First%20DAG). 
Using Kafka, we developed proficiency in creating producers and consumers, as well as in generating data files. In the case of Airflow, we gained familiarity with writing and executing DAGs.


### Part 2: [Databases]
Throughout this section, we acquired practical knowledge on utilizing [SQL](https://github.com/Kristie00/My-projects/tree/main/SQL%20exercises) for manipulating relational databases in MSSQL. 
Furthermore, we also gained proficiency in managing document-oriented database [MongoDB](https://github.com/Kristie00/My-projects/tree/main/MongoDB) through the usage of MongoDB Query Language.
